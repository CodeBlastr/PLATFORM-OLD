ZuHa is a content management, customer relationship manaagement, project management, (soon to be ecommerce) platform built on the CakePHP rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC. 

Our primary goal is to provide a full business management system.  From where leads come in, to how you fulfill their orders, and all of the details in between.  All while solving the problem of the piecemeal systems that currently exist.  If you want your own ecommerce platform with a forum, multi-user blogs, crm, cms, and user profiles, groups, wikis and more... you're basically stuck with piecing at least two if not many more systems together into one. We aim to make a single system where all of these systems are in use if and when you want them to be with the push of a button.
