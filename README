ZuHa is a complete business management system built on CakePHP, the rapid development framework for PHP. 

Our primary goal is to provide a single system that handles your business process from start to finish.  From leads generated by your website, to tracking those leads through your sales funnel, all the way to managing the orders places and fulfilling service and product requests.  

All while solving a problem faced by many website systems, where in order to have an ecommerce site, with a crm, cms, project management, user profiles. groups, messaging, multi-user blogs, forums , events, wikis or any combination of those sub systems, you would at a minimum be forced to combine 2 systems or more into one by coaxing them into speaking to each other. 

By enabling pre-installed sub systems only when you need them, we aim to create a wrapper system where all of your sub systems talk to each other out of the box, when and where you need them to.

INSTALLATION TIPS
 - If you're not working with a multi-site setup, simply upload the files to the root directory of the site so that you have a minimum of..
 
 ROOT/app
 ROOT/cake
 
 ... directories.  Then create a database.php file in ROOT/app/config/ using ROOT/app/config/database.default.php as a template, fixing the variables with correct values. 
 
 - ROOT/database.sql has the latest database dump for a bare (maybe some testing data) included for import.
 
 - Zuha works best when installed at a root domain or subdomain of a site.  (ex. myDomain.com OR subDomain.myDomain.com OR subDomain.localhost).
 
 - It is possible to get it to get a Hello World setup inside a sub directory, but you must rename or delete the ROOT/.htaccess file.  However, please note : webroot files (css / js / etc) will not work without further customization.  So its virtually worthless to use it in sub directories.
