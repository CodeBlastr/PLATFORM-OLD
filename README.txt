# ZuHa is a complete business management system on an MVC framework for maximum ease and expandability.

Our primary goal is to provide a single system that handles your business process from start to finish.  From leads generated by your website, to tracking those leads through your sales funnel, all the way to managing and fulfilling service and product requests.  

We further seek to solve the problem faced by many website systems, where in order to have multiple functions (like ecommerce, CRM, CMS, project management, social networking, groups, messaging, multi-user blogs, forums, events, wikis or any combination of those sub systems), you would at a minimum be forced to combine 2 systems or more into one by somehow convincing the two (or more) systems to talk each other. 

# November 2010 Accomplishments

What a killer few weeks its been...

In just the last 4-6 weeks we have made huge improvements to zuha, and it is much closer to being the business development and collaboration platform we've been envisioning!  I might even dare say it is feeling very close to being the most technically advanced CMS I know of.   In just the last few weeks this is what has been accomplished...

* 1 : Built in custom forms  -   This page : http://swiftrax.com/clients was built 100% through a user interface that the end user can use.  No php or html coding required.  But heres the great part!  That user created form is related to already existing features and as you add fields it will automatically update the structure of the database so that data automatically gets saved to the place where it is most usable!!!  Such as a contact lead or quote request.  And in case you don't instantly envision what this functionality really means...  It is the beginning of the ability to create entire business applications.  (ie. customer support tickets, user generated webpages, quotes, invoices, and more) all through a user interface where you just plug form elements in and set their visibility type add, edit and view.  All while keeping everything around the form 100% editable through the inline page editor mentioned below.

* 2 : Workflows -  One action, can automatically trigger a whole series of follow up actions.  Think about a customer support request, and how once it comes in, you want a few people notified, you may want reminders to go out on the due date, you may need to make a quote to fill the ticket request, and maybe you want that user put into your customer retention email newsletter.   With workflows you can automate all of the routine follow up tasks that go with that action.  (heck you can even create automatic actions from just a page view -- So if a logged in user visits page x, maybe we would send them a text message letting them know you thought they'd be interested in page z!  OR when someone fills out a contact page, send them an email every day for the next 6 months - pounding them until they buy that product they were looking at!)

* These two things working together mean that we can develop at about twice the speed, because we'd only need to write the "text messaging" function for example, and then handle all of the user interaction with that function through workflows and custom forms.  


* 3 : Mutli Site Support -  If you host with us a single install of this software can host an unlimited number of websites, and each website can be fully customized without effecting any other site, all while leaving the core system fully upgradeable.  This has the added benefit of every single function we make for one site being automatically available to EVERY other site.  So if your customer x, wants the text messaging feature added, we build it, and every other customer now has the ability to text message from their site... instantly.

* 4 : In Line Page Editing  -   In support of becoming the ultimate easy CMS we have nearly completed the ability to edit your website pages WHILE looking at your website pages.  Visit this page : http://213.239.218.92:81/webpages/webpages/view/3  (user: admin, pass: test)  and click the pencil icon in the top left (that pencil icon toggles page edit ability).  Then mouse over some text on the page, (it should get a red background), then click it.  You can edit your webpages using an inline WYSIWYG editor --- and if it is the sidebar for example (a site wide element) - you would be updating your entire site!!!!  (And yes, I know there is some work to do on the look and feel of that function, but hopefully you get a feel for how powerful that is, and that was just started last week!)

* 5 : Record Level Access Control  -   You can manage every single page of your site and control who has access to it down to the individual record level.  You can create new user groups and create whole sections of your site which only they have access to.   All through a user interface consisting of clicking some checkboxes next to the pages or sections you want user groups to access. 


## Installation Tips

* Upload the files to the root directory 
 
* Ceate a database.php file in ROOT/app/config/ using ROOT/app/config/database.default.php as a template, fixing the variables with correct values. 
 
* Import ROOT/database.sql - latest bare database dump (maybe some testing data) included.
 
* ZuHa works best when installed at a root domain or subdomain of a site.  (ex. myDomain.com OR subDomain.myDomain.com OR subDomain.localhost).
 
* It is possible to get it to get a Hello World setup inside a sub directory, but you must rename or delete the ROOT/.htaccess file.  However, please note : webroot files (css / js / etc) will not work without further customization.  So its virtually worthless to use it in sub directories.
 
* Once you have a working view of the site you can login with the user "admin" and the password "test" in order to gain access to every available page.
